# Hash Tables: Ice Cream Parlor
**Medium**

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor

Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool their money to buy ice cream. On any given day, the parlor offers a line of flavors. Each flavor has a cost associated with it.

Given the value of $money$ and the $cost$ of each flavor for $t$ trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two *distinct* flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money during each visit. ID numbers are the *1- based* index number associated with a $cost$.  For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.

**Example**   

$cost = [2,1,3,5,6]$    
$money = 5$    

They would purchase flavor ID's $1$ and $3$ for a cost of $2 + 3 = 5$.  Use $1$ based indexing for your response.  

**Note:** 

- Two ice creams having unique IDs $i$ and $j$ *may* have the same cost (i.e., $cost[i] \equiv cost[j]$).
- There will always be a unique solution.

**Function Description**

Complete the function *whatFlavors* in the editor below.   

whatFlavors has the following parameter(s):

-  *int cost[n]* the prices for each flavor  
-  *int money:* the amount of money they have to spend   

**Prints**   

- *int int:* the indices of the two flavors they will purchase as two space-separated integers on a line

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, $t$, the number of trips to the ice cream parlor. 

Each of the next $t$ sets of $3$ lines is as follows:  

- The first line contains $money$. 
- The second line contains an integer, $n$, the size of the array $cost$. 
- The third line contains $n$ space-separated integers denoting the $cost[i]$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \le t \le 50$  
- $2 \le money \le 10^9$   
- $2 \le n \le 5* 10^4$   
- $1 \le cost[i] \le 10^9$

# Count Sorted Vowel Strings
__Medium__  

Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels `(a, e, i, o, u)` and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

 

__Example 1:__  
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].
```  

__Example 2:__  
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
```  

Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.
__Example 3:__  
```
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045
 
```  


__Constraints:__
```
1 <= n <= 50
```

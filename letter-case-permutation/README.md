**Medium**

https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-case-permutation/

Given a string s, we can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return a *list of all possible strings* we could create. You can return the output in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "a1b2"
Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "3z4"
Output: ["3z4","3Z4"]
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "12345"
Output: ["12345"]
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "0"
Output: ["0"]
```

**Constraints:**

- s will be a string with length between 1 and 12.
- s will consist only of letters or digits.
